# ETCSL3Localization

This repository contains models of the GNSS-based virtual balises for train localization, especially in the context ERTMS/ETCS Level 3 operation with Fixed Virtual Blocks. Our models have been created with the UPPAAL SMC tool - version 4.1.26 (http://www.uppaal.org/).

The models and analyses are being published in the Open Journal of ITS (2022). Some preliminary results have been developed and first published in CTS 2021 (https://cts2021.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr). The current models improve (several issues fixed) and extend those preliminary versions by adding new modules. Descriptions of the various models are given as comments at the beginning of the declaration page of each module.

This work has been partly funded by the PERFORMINGRAIL Shift2Rail European project (https://www.performingrail.com)
